# ReactProjects

These are the projects I built using React. React Native

The weather app is a React Application to receive weather details for any part of the world using Rest API's

The TravelCities app has 2 Modules.
Module 1 : User retrieved data set of To Visit list in any City/Country.
Module 2 : The Above Data set is used to suggest outing spots to new users visitng any city around the globe(Provided the Dataset has some previous entries).

The To Do List app is a application that I have developed for personal use and works just like any other ToDo list app ( PS . It was my first app in ReactJs so kept it simple!)
